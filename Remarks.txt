these are stuff to be fixed in frontend:

- make a human friendly signla for end of game
- add a signal for who won the game
- if the player just finished the game and wants to start a new game, ake a buton for that, because now he needs to clik on ft_transcendence
and chose duel
- I didnt try tournament yet

- the game still stops at score 2- 0 then restart and back appears !!! 

- I would guess the game has to have a timer, otherwhise unteil when would th person play 

- can you read the subject again I am sure it was said the player must have a unique name , it is the same as the username ?? or a unique name 
for the game ? if the later then reput the display_name I already designed to that end!
