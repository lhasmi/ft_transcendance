        Enter the URL http://localhost:8000/players/.
        Hit send and see the JSON response.

        Set the method to POST.
        Enter the URL http://localhost:8000/players/.
        Under Headers, set Content-Type to application/json.
        In the body, select raw and input a JSON object: {"username": "newplayer", "email": "player@example.com"}.
        Hit send to create a new entry.
