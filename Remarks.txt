these are stuff to be fixed in frontend:

- make a human friendly signla for end of game
- add a signal for who won the game
- if the player just finished the game and wants to start a new game, ake a buton for that, because now he needs to clik on ft_transcendence
and chose duel
- I didnt try tournament yet
