- a small image gets uploaded and replaces the default   image, a big one doenst raise any error at all, I am pushing the 
example image in here just for testing purposes, check testimage.jpeg  , but the picture updatedimage.jpg got updated successfully ! 
also , the even if the updatedimage.jpg is updated in the website it is not uploaded in the host backend media directory, which means, the 
update will be  deleted if we delete the containers 

- some 2 direction movement has to be done between the containers and host directories
